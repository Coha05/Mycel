## TL;DR

[Mycel](https://mycel.land/) is a decentralized platform designed for cross-chain asset transfer, management, and trading. Built on Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, Mycel allows users to create "Transferable Accounts" (TAs) that combine user accounts with threshold signature schemes (TSS) signed by validators. This unique architecture enables secure and decentralized control over assets across different blockchain platforms.
